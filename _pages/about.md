Hi 👋, I’m Habib.

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m an Electrical Engineer from ETH Zürich and EPFL, specializing in Embedded Systems and Edge AI. I am dedicated to building technology that creates a real-world positive impact.

I have 3+ years of experience developing medical devices and high-precision systems. My background includes:

- **Johnson & Johnson MedTech:** Worked within the Digital & Robotics R&D team to automate surgical robot tracking accuracy assessment using C++. On top of that I was responsible for IEC60601 evaluation, contributed to design-for-manufacturing (DFM), and change management.

- **Chipiron:** Designed low-noise analog front-ends and mixed-signal control systems for a new generation of MRI machines.

- **Research & Thesis Work:** Developing a deep-infrared blood-pressure wearable using Zephyr RTOS and real-time ECG/PPG processing.

I enjoy solving complex problems, finding efficient solutions quickly, and maintaining a "big picture" perspective. I thrive in environments surrounded by passionate, driven people who bring positive energy to the team.
