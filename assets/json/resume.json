His technical expertise, combined with his professional attitude and personality, are among the best I have seen in an intern.\n As SME in Electrical Engineering, he provided valuable support to the R&D team during the Design Transfer phase of the robotic spinal surgery device, “Velys Spine,” particularly in change management and IEC 60601 testing. \n Habib also developed an automated accuracy testing method for the Stereo-IR Navigation System using C++ and Python. His setup was instrumental in investigating the effects of Gamma sterilization on disposable navigation arrays, and he authored detailed reports and manuals to document his work. \n I highly recommend Habib without hesitation and am confident he has a bright future ahead."}]}
